class IamPolicy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.

      matching admission request will always be permitted. This feature is
      typically used to exclude Google or third-party infrastructure images
      from Binary Authorization policies.
    clusterAdmissionRules: Optional. Per-cluster admission rules. Cluster spec
      format: `location.clusterId`. There can be at most one admission rule
      per cluster spec. A `location` is either a compute zone (e.g. us-
      central1-a) or a region (e.g. us-central1). For `clusterId` syntax
      restrictions see https://cloud.google.com/container-
      engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters.
    defaultAdmissionRule: Required. Default admission rule for a cluster
      without a per-cluster, per- kubernetes-service-account, or per-istio-
      service-identity admission rule.
    description: Optional. A descriptive comment.
    globalPolicyEvaluationMode: Optional. Controls the evaluation of a Google-
      maintained global admission policy for common system-level images.
      Images not covered by the global policy will be subject to the project
      admission policy. This setting has no effect when specified inside a
      global admission policy.
    name: Output only. The resource name, in the format `projects/*/policy`.
      There is at most one policy per project.
    updateTime: Output only. Time when the policy was last updated.

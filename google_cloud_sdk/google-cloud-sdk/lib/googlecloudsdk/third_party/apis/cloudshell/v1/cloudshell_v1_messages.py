      It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as
      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method
      that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type,
      if any.
    ResponseValue: The normal response of the operation in case of success.
      If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
      `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
      methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is
      the original method name.  For example, if the original method name is

    done: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in

    metadata: Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It

      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method
      that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type,
      if any.
    name: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same
      service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping,
      the `name` should be a resource name ending with
      `operations/{unique_id}`.
    response: The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the
      original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the

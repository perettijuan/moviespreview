    description: |-
      Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing

      requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a
      match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made
      available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if
      its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
      filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
      metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of
      its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels in the provided
      metadata. metadataFilters specified here can be overrides those
      specified in ForwardingRule that refers to this UrlMap.
      metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

source:
  api_field: function.dockerImageUri
  arg_name: source
  help_text: |
    Location of source code to deploy.

    Location of the source can be one of the following:

    * Source code in Google Cloud Storage (must be an archive),
    * Already deployed Edge Function image in Google Container Registry,
    * Local filesystem path (root directory of function source).

    The value of the flag will be interpreted as a Cloud Storage location,
    if it starts with `gs://`.

    The value will be interpreted as a reference to Container Registry, if it
    starts with `[REGION.]gcr.io/`. Available values for REGION are: asia, us, eu.

    Otherwise, it will be interpreted as the local filesystem path. When
    deploying source from the local filesystem, this command skips files
    specified in the `.gcloudignore` file (see `gcloud topic gcloudignore`
    for more information). If the `.gcloudignore` file doesn't exist, the
    command will try to create it.

    If the source location is not explicitly set, new functions will deploy
    from the current directory. Existing functions keep their old source.

  help_text: Description for the Edge Function.

timeout:
  api_field: function.requestTimeout
  arg_name: timeout
  default: 540s
  help_text: |-
    The function execution timeout, e.g. 30s for 30 seconds. Defaults to
    original value for existing function or 60 seconds for new functions.
    Cannot be more than 540s.
    See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

entry_point:
  api_field: function.entryPoint
  arg_name: entry-point
  help_text: |-
    By default when an Edge Function is triggered, it executes a
    JavaScript function with the same name. Or, if it cannot find a
    function with the same name, it executes a function named `function`.
    You can use this flag to override the default behavior, by specifying
    the name of a JavaScript function that will be executed when the
    Edge Function is triggered.

function_type:
  api_field: function.functionType
  arg_name: function-type
  help_text: |-
    Type of the Edge function. An on-demand function is triggered for every publish
    to the input topics, and a stream-processing function listens to the input topics,
    process data, and publishes to the output topics.
  default: on-demand
  choices:
  - arg_value: on-demand
    enum_value: ON_DEMAND
  - arg_value: stream-processing
    enum_value: STREAM_PROCESSING

architecture:
  arg_name: arch
  choices:
  - arg_value: x86-64
    enum_value: X86_64
  - arg_value: armhf
    enum_value: ARMHF
  - arg_value: aarch64
    enum_value: AARCH64
  help_text: Architecture to build Edge function for.

gcs_source_staging_dir:
  arg_name: gcs-source-staging-dir
  help_text: |-
    A directory in Google Cloud Storage to copy the source used for staging the build.
    If the specified bucket does not exist, Cloud Build will create one.
    If you don't set this field, ```gs://[PROJECT_ID]_cloudbuild/source``` is used.

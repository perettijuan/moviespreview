      Remove an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a Cloud Build Artifacts repository.
    description: |
      *{command}* removes an IAM policy binding from the IAM policy of a Cloud Build Artifacts
      repository. One binding consists of a member, a role, and an optional condition.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * The repository specified does not exist.
        * The active account does not have permission to access the given
          repository's IAM policies.
    examples: |
      To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of 'roles/editor' for the user
      'test-user@gmail.com' with repository 'my-repo', run:

        $ {command} my-repo --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/editor'

      See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of
      policy role and member types.

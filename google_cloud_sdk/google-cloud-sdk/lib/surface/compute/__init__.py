        The gcloud compute command group lets you create, configure and
        manipulate Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

        With Compute Engine you can create and run virtual machines
        on Google infrastructure. Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and
        value that allows you to easily launch large compute clusters on
        Google's infrastructure.

        More information on Compute Engine can be found here:
        https://cloud.google.com/compute/ and detailed documentation can be
        found here: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/

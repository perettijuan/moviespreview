    description: |
      Create a worker pool in the specified instance.
    examples: |
      The following command creates a worker pool called 'pool1' in the instance called
      'default_instance' with 25 workers configured with default machine type (n1-standard-2) and
      disk size (200Gb):

        $ {command} pool1 --instance=default_instance --worker-count=25

      The following command creates a worker pool called 'heftypool' in the instance called
      'default_instance' with 5 workers configured with 64 cores and 2000Gb disks:

        $ {command} heftypool --instance=default_instance --worker-count=5 --disk-size=2000 --machine-type=n1-standard-64

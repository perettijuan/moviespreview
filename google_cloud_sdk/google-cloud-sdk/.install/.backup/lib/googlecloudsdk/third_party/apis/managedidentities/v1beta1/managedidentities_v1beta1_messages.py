      SECURITY_REALM: Any of the security realms in the IAMContext (go
        /security-realms). When used with IN, the condition indicates "any of
        the request's realms match one of the given values; with NOT_IN, "none

        (e.g., 'realms-for-borg-cell-xx', see: go/realm-groups) A match is
        determined by a realm group membership check performed by a

        not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of a

        are normal and supported.
      CREDENTIALS_TYPE: What type of credentials have been supplied with this
        request. String values should match enum names from
        security_loas_l2.CredentialsType - currently, only
        CREDS_TYPE_EMERGENCY is supported. It is not permitted to grant access

      information of published maintenance schedule.
    ProducerMetadataValue: Output only. Custom string attributes used
      primarily to expose producer-specific information in monitoring

  Fields:
    consumerDefinedName: consumer_defined_name is the name that is set by the

      consumer_defined_name is used for notification/UI purposes for consumer
      to recognize their instances.
    createTime: Output only. Timestamp when the resource was created.

      `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
    producerMetadata: Output only. Custom string attributes used primarily to
      expose producer-specific information in monitoring dashboards. See go
      /get-instance-metadata.
    provisionedResources: Output only. The list of data plane resources
      provisioned for this instance, e.g. compute VMs. See go/get-instance-
      metadata.
    rolloutMetadata: The map between RolloutType and the corresponding
      RolloutMetadata. This is only mutated by rollout service. For actuation
      implementation, this information is pass-through for Rollout management.
      Producer shall not modify by itself. For update of a single entry in
      this map, the update field mask shall follow this sementics: go
      /advanced-field-masks
    slmInstanceTemplate: Link to the SLM instance template. Only populated
      when updating SLM instances via SSA's Actuation service adaptor. Service
      producers with custom control plane (e.g. Cloud SQL) doesn't need to
      populate this field. Instead they should use software_versions.
    sloMetadata: Output only. SLO metadata for instance classification in the
      Standardized dataplane SLO platform. See go/cloud-ssa-standard-slo for
      feature description.
    softwareVersions: Software versions that are used to deploy this instance.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",
  "domain:google.com",             "serviceAccount:my-project-
  id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"           ]         },         {

  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    iamOwned: A boolean attribute.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied.   Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is   granted.
      Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.

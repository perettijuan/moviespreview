      concurrency. It is not planned to propagate this field to GA and it will
      be eventually removed from the API.
    desiredAddonsConfig: Configurations for the various addons available to
      run in the cluster.
    desiredBinaryAuthorization: The desired configuration options for the
      Binary Authorization feature.
    desiredCloudNatStatus: The desired status of Cloud NAT for this cluster.

      cluster.
    desiredCostManagementConfig: The desired configuration for the fine-
      grained cost management feature.

      cluster and desired_node_pool_id is not provided then the change applies
      to that single node pool.
    desiredNodePoolId: The node pool to be upgraded. This field is mandatory

      Maximum number of instances for this group. Required for primary workers.
      Note that by default, clusters will not use secondary workers. Required
      for secondary workers if the minimum secondary instances is set.Primary
      workers - Bounds: [min_instances, ). Secondary workers - Bounds:

  weight:
    description: |-
      Weight for instance group. Determines fraction of total workers in cluster
      that will be composed of instances from this instance group (e.g. if
      primary workers have weight 2 and secondary workers have weight 1, then
      the cluster should have approximately 2 primary workers to each secondary
      worker. Cluster may not reach these exact weights if constrained by
      min/max bounds or other autoscaling configurations.Note that all groups
      have an equal weight by default, so the cluster will attempt to maintain
      an equal number of workers in each group within configured size bounds per
      group. The cluster may not reach this balance of weights if not allowed by
      worker-count bounds. For example, if max_instances for secondary workers
      is 0, only primary workers will be added. The cluster can also be out of
      balance when created.Default: 1.

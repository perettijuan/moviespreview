  internalIpOnly:
    description: |-
      If true, all instances in the cluster will only have internal IP
      addresses. By default, clusters are not restricted to internal IP
      addresses, and will have ephemeral external IP addresses assigned to each
      instance. This internal_ip_only restriction can only be enabled for
      subnetwork enabled networks, and all off-cluster dependencies must be
      configured to be accessible without external IP addresses.

  metadata:
    description: |-
      The Compute Engine metadata entries to add to all instances (see Project
      and instance metadata (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs /storing-
      retrieving-metadata#project_and_instance_metadata)).

      type: string
  networkUri:
    description: |-
      The Compute Engine network to be used for machine communications. Cannot
      be specified with subnetwork_uri. If neither network_uri nor
      subnetwork_uri is specified, the "default" network of the project is used,
      if it exists. Cannot be a "Custom Subnet Network" (see Using Subnetworks
      for more information).A full URL, partial URI, or short name are valid.
      Examples: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/pr
      ojects/[project_id]/regions/global/default
      projects/[project_id]/regions/global/default default
    type: string
  serviceAccount:
    description: |-
      The service account of the instances. Defaults to the default Compute
      Engine service account. Custom service accounts need permissions
      equivalent to the following IAM roles: roles/logging.logWriter
      roles/storage.objectAdmin(see
      https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-
      accounts#custom_service_accounts for more information). Example:
      [account_id]@[project_id].iam.gserviceaccount.com
    type: string
  serviceAccountScopes:
    description: |-
      The URIs of service account scopes to be included in Compute Engine
      instances. The following base set of scopes is always included:
      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud.useraccounts.readonly
      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write
      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.writeIf no scopes are specified,
      the following defaults are also provided:
      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery
      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigtable.admin.table
      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigtable.data

      type: string
  subnetworkUri:
    description: |-
      The Compute Engine subnetwork to be used for machine communications.
      Cannot be specified with network_uri.A full URL, partial URI, or short
      name are valid. Examples: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projec
      ts/[project_id]/regions/us- east1/sub0 projects/[project_id]/regions
      /us-east1/sub0 sub0
    type: string

      The Compute Engine tags to add to all instances (see Tagging
      instances).
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  zoneUri:
    description: |-
      The zone where the Compute Engine cluster will be located. On a
      create request, it is required in the "global" region. If omitted
      in a non-global Cloud Dataproc region, the service will pick a
      zone in the corresponding Compute Engine region. On a get request,
      zone will always be present.A full URL, partial URI, or short name
      are valid. Examples: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/project

  IPAddress:
    description: |-
      IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends traffic
      to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the target
      that you specify in the forwarding rule.  If you don't specify a reserved
      IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned. Methods for specifying an
      IP address:  * IPv4 dotted decimal, as in `100.1.2.3` * Full URL, as in
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v
      1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL
      or by name, as in: * projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses
      /address-name * regions/region/addresses/address-name * global/addresses
      /address-name * address-name   The loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding
      rule's target determine the type of IP address that you can use. For
      detailed information, refer to [IP address specifications ](/load-
      balancing/docs/forwarding-rule- concepts#ip_address_specifications).
    type: string
  IPProtocol:
    description: |-
      The IP protocol to which this rule applies. Valid options are TCP, UDP,
      ESP, AH, SCTP or ICMP.  For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, the load
      balancing scheme is INTERNAL, and one of TCP or UDP are valid. For Traffic
      Director, the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, and only
      TCPis valid. For Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing, the load balancing
      scheme is INTERNAL_MANAGED, and only TCP is valid. For HTTP(S), SSL Proxy,
      and TCP Proxy Load Balancing, the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL and
      only TCP is valid. For Network TCP/UDP Load Balancing, the load balancing
      scheme is EXTERNAL, and one of TCP or UDP is valid.

  allPorts:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. This field
      cannot be used with port or portRange fields. When the load balancing
      scheme is INTERNAL and protocol is TCP/UDP, specify this field to allow
      packets addressed to any ports will be forwarded to the backends
      configured with this forwarding rule.
    type: boolean
  backendService:
    description: |-
      This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.  For internal load
      balancing, this field identifies the BackendService resource to receive

      are IPV4 or IPV6. This can only be specified for an external global
      forwarding rule.

  metadataFilters:
    description: |-
      Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
      configuration to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
      requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a match
      takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available to those
      proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria
      is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the
      corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria
      is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
      corresponding labels in the provided metadata. metadataFilters specified
      here can be overridden by those specified in the UrlMap that this
      ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers
      that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: MetadataFilter.yaml
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    type: string
  network:
    description: |-
      This field is not used for external load balancing.  For INTERNAL and
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, this field identifies the
      network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding
      Rule. If this field is not specified, the default network will be
      used.
    type: string
  networkTier:
    description: |-
      This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load
      balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM , STANDARD.
      For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and
      STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM.  If
      this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress
      is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the
      Address.

    enum:
    - PREMIUM
    - STANDARD
  portRange:
    description: This field is deprecated. See the port field.
    type: string
  ports:
    description: |-
      List of comma-separated ports. The forwarding rule forwards packets
      with matching destination ports. If the forwarding rule's
      loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, and the forwarding rule references a
      target pool, specifying ports is optional. You can specify an
      unlimited number of ports, but they must be contiguous. If you omit
      ports, GCP forwards traffic on any port of the forwarding rule's
      protocol.  If the forwarding rule's loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL,
      and the forwarding rule references a target HTTP proxy, target HTTPS
      proxy, target TCP proxy, target SSL proxy, or target VPN gateway, you
      must specify ports using the following constraints:    -
      TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080  -

  region:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule
      resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.

  serviceLabel:
    description: |-
      An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
      If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified
      service name.  The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long
      and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
      which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and
      all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or
      digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.  This
      field is only used for internal load balancing.
    type: string
  serviceName:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for this
      Forwarding Rule.  This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    type: string
  subnetwork:
    description: |-
      This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.  For internal
      load balancing, this field identifies the subnetwork that the load
      balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.  If the
      network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional.
      However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork
      must be specified.
    type: string
  target:
    description: |-
      The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For
      regional forwarding rules, this target must live in the same
      region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this
      target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded
      traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. For
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, only HTTP and HTTPS targets
      are valid.

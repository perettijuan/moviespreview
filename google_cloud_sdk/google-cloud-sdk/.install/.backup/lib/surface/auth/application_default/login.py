  r"""Acquire new user credentials to use for Application Default Credentials.

  Note: Consider using a service account and the complementary `gcloud auth
  activate-service-account` to authorize access to Google Cloud Platform. For
  details on authorizing with a service account, see
  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorizing_with_a_service_account.

  Obtains user access credentials via a web flow and puts them in the
  well-known location for Application Default Credentials to use them as a
  proxy for a service account.

  This command is useful when you are developing code that would normally
  use a service account but need to run the code in a local development
  environment where it's easier to provide user credentials. The credentials
  will apply to all API calls that make use of the Application Default
  Credentials client library. Moreover, the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
  environment variable which is set depending on the code's environment cannot
  be set once this command is run. To manually set this variable, refer to
  instructions at
  https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#calling.

  API enablement and quotas are managed by the master Application Default
  Credentials project. In the case of errors related to the API not being
  enabled or quota limitations, use the `--client-id-file` flag. You can create
  the client-id-file at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials.

  This command has no effect on the user account(s) set up by the
  `gcloud auth login` command.

  Any credentials previously generated by
  `gcloud auth application-default login` will be overwritten.

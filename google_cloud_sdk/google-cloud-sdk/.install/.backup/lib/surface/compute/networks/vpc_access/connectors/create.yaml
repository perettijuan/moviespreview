    description: |
      Create a new VPC Access connector with the given name.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * An instance with the same name already exists.
        * The active account does not have permission to create instances.

      The following command creates a VPC Access connector with name 'my-vpc-connector'
      in region 'us-central1' in network 'my-network' with IP CIDR range of '10.132.0.0/28'.

        $ {command} my-vpc-connector --region=us-central1 --network=my-network

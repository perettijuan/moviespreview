    brief:  Start Deployment rollout by providing a new game server template.
    description: |
      Start Deployment rollout by providing a new game server template. The game server template
      should include the game server spec that will be sent to Agones during rollout.

      A Deployment rollout updates game servers with a new image. The new image is specified through
      the spec-file field of game server template. It is a path to a JSON or YAML file that contains
      game server spec that follows the format of the spec field in Agones GameServer custom
      resource. Please see https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/gameserver/ for more details.

      The new game server template can be specified either through creating a new Deployment
      resource or through the start-rollout verb on an existing Deployment resource
      (`gcloud game servers deployments start-rollout`).

      Once the new game server template is specified, you can start the rollout by changing the
      percentage of game servers that run the new image through the set-rollout-target verb
      (`gcloud game servers deployments set-rollout-target`). The set-rollout-target verb specifies
      labels for clusters that should get the new image. It also specifies what percentage of game
      servers in each of the specified clusters should run the new image.

      Finally, you can finish the rollout using the commit verb
      (`gcloud game servers deployments commit`). This will set the rollout percentage to 100 in
      all clusters whose labels were previously specified by calling the set-rollout-target verb.

      If you need to revert a rollout, you can use the revert-rollout verb
      (`gcloud game servers deployments revert-rollout`) which deletes game servers running the new
      image.

          spec. The game server spec follows the format of the spec field in Agones GameServer
          custom resource. Please see https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/gameserver/ for more

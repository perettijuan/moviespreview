  brief: Troubleshoot the IAM Policy.
  description: |
   Performs a check on whether a member is granted a
   permission on a resource and how that grant/deny is determined according to
   the resource's effective IAM policy interpretation.

  examples: |
    To troubleshoot a permission of a member on a resource, run:

      $ {command} //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/project-id
      --principal-email=my-iam-account@somedomain.com
      --permission=resourcemanager.projects.get

    See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies for more information about

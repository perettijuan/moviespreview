    brief:  |
      Get IAM policy for a Cloud Build Artifacts repository.
    description: |
      *{command}* displays the IAM policy associated with a Cloud Build Artifacts repository.
      The output includes an "etag" identifier that is used to check for concurrent policy
      updates. An edited policy should include the same etag so that *set-iam-policy* applies
      the changes to the correct policy version.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * The repository specified does not exist.
        * The active account does not have permission to access the given
          repository's IAM policies.
    examples: |
      To print the IAM policy for repository `my-repo`, run:

        $ {command} get-iam-policy my-repo
